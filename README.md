# Ethereum Multiplication and Division Project

## Overview
This project is a simple Ethereum-based application that performs multiplication and division operations using a Solidity smart contract deployed on the blockchain. Users can interact with the contract via a web-based interface implemented with React and ethers.js.

## Features
- Perform multiplication and division operations on two integers.
- View the result of the last operation.
- Connect to the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask.
- Automatically fetch the result from the smart contract.

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: For the smart contract.
- **Hardhat**: For development and testing of the smart contract.
- **React**: For the frontend.
- **ethers.js**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask**: As a browser-based wallet to connect to the blockchain.

## Prerequisites
1. **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js (v16 or later) installed.
2. **MetaMask**: Install the MetaMask extension in your browser.
3. **Hardhat**: Install globally or in the project directory.
